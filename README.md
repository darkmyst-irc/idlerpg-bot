IdleRPG bot with comfort tweaks

**For the untamed original, see https://idlerpg.net/source.php**

This version of IdleRPG has been nerfed for a more pleasant experience, since we're basically milksops at Darkmyst, and also roleplayers who nickchange a lot.

Changes done so far:

- nick changes no longer trigger quest failures
- nick changes penalties are capped an order of magnitude lower than other standard penalties
- quests are over more quickly (reducing the time-window in which they might be broken)
- people who break the quest are penalised more harshly (= normally) than other users (= 15 weaksauce minutes)
- even the harshest quest penalty does not exceed the standard penalty cap

More affectionate hand-holding will be added in as we think of it.
